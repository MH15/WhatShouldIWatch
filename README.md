# What Should I Watch? :movie_camera:

*[What Should I Watch?](https://whatshouldiwatch-test.herokuapp.com)* finds the best movies playing in your area currently, then shows you pertinent information for each title.

## About

The motivation for this project comes from my personal experiences in choosing a movie to watch. It's a small problem to be sure but one where there was no sufficient solution.
